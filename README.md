# Coding-Practice

This repository consists questions and answers of all the coding questions I have been solving to enhance and refine my coding skills from sites like Hackerrank and Leetcode. Some questions maybe very basic and some extremely difficult. 

Most of these questions are in Java. However, some questions involve solutions in MySQL, JavaScript as well.
